  <h1>My Love of Hot Air Balloons</h1>

  <h2>Why do I love hot air balloons, you ask?</h2>
    <p> From a young age, I have always loved hot air balloons. I love seeing the unique designs of the balloons and the color schemes each one has! </p>
    <p> I have been to a hot air balloon festival in Wisconsin. I try to go each year because I love seeing them. There are usually about twenty balloons that go up. This is an event I hate to miss because it is something one does not normally see every day. They usually land wherever they can which is often in a grass field somewhere. I have noticed they have no control over the direction in which they go because each year the wind decides where that is going to be. Because of this, weather is an important factor in this event. Rain threatens to cancel it on some years.
