  <h1>My Favorite Season</h1>

  <h2>Fall</h2>
    <p> I love fall because the weather starts to get cooler and is more comfortable to me. If you get a little chilly, you can even put on a cozy sweater! </p>
    <p> I also like going to pumpkin patches during this time because it is so beautiful outside. It's nice to do activities outside in Fall before Winter comes. I love seeing the pretty colors when the leaves start to change as well. Taking a nice walk or car ride to see the changes is something fun I like to do. The only sad part about Fall is that it does not last long, so I try to remember to enjoy it!
