  <h1>My Favorite Tourist Attraction</h1>

  <h2>Dollywood</h2>
    <p> Dollywood is located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. I am thankful to say that I have been able to travel to Dollywood many times! It is an amusement park founded by a country singer named Dolly Parton. </p>
    <p> Dollywood has so much to offer! It not only has amusement rides, but also a train, restaurants to eat at, shops to visit, and live shows to watch. One of my favorite things to do is ride on the train located in the park!
